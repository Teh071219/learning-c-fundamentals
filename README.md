# C Programming Studies - UAb

This repository documents my academic journey and technical evolution in the **Laboratory of Programming** unit at Universidade Aberta. 

## 🎯 Objectives
- Master C syntax and programming logic.
- Understand low-level operations: memory management, pointers, and buffers.
- Implement structured and modular code following university standards.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized into learning modules to track my progress:

- `Módulo 1/`: Introduction to C, variables, data types, and basic I/O.
- `Módulo 2/`: Control flow and functions (Upcoming).
- `Assignments/`: Specific folders for **E-fólios** and academic evaluations.

## 🛠️ Environment & Compilation
I use the GCC compiler to build these projects. To compile any `.c` file, use:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
